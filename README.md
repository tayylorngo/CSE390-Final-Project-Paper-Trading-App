# Stock Market Paper Trading Android App

This Android application allows you to simulate trading assets in the stock market. 
This acts as a fake brokerage account similar to that of Robinhood and other trading platforms.

## Adding Funds to Account
You can add funds to your account via the settings screen. Similarly you can withdraw funds from there as well.

## Buying Assets
You can search for an asset using the symbol the asset has, (ex: APPL for Apple, MSFT for Microsoft).
From there, you can purchase any amount of shares. (Fractional shares are enabled!)

## Real-time Data

This application uses the Financial Modeling Prep API to gather real-time asset data. You can use the refresh button on the home screen to update your data. 
Whenever you switch to the home screen, the data should also automatically update.
